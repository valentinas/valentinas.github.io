{"name":"vbakaitis.net","tagline":"vbakaitis on net","body":"### High speed 2 port embedded USB hub design (FE1.1S chip)\r\n\r\nI needed a small USB hub that could fit in tight spaces (inside the casing of a mouse or keyboard, etc). The speed is not important here, so I chose the simplest IC I could find. It also meant that the hub was very cheap to make.\r\n\r\nI used Eagle to design the PCB. I have never used Eagle before, so I looked around for tutorials and found [these three videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL868B73617C6F6FAD) that outline the PCB design basics by [Jeremy Blum](http://www.jeremyblum.com/).\r\n\r\nIt took me two iterations to debug it and get it right. First version did not have enough decoupling capacitors. I made a false assumption that 0.1uf capacitor would not make any difference in parallel with 10uf capacitor. In reality it protects from the voltage drop in high frequency circuits. I also failed to connect some of the IC pins together.\r\n\r\nPart list:\r\n* FE1.1s chip (I could not find it on digikey, but aliexpress had plenty on offer for as low as $5 for 10 pieces)\r\n* 10uf (106) 0603 capacitor (x3) (digikey has plenty of them, but for prototyping purposes I got a pack of 2000 capacitors of variable values from aliexpress, which only cost me arund $5 including shipping via registered post. It takes a while to get stuff from aliexpress (digikey delivers very fast), but it's much cheaper)\r\n* 0.1uf (104) 0603 capacitor (x2) (this was included in the capacitor pack too)\r\n* 2.7K 0603 resistor (for this I bough a similar 0603 resistor pack from aliexpress for couple of bucks)\r\n\r\nDownload Eagle .brd and .sch files.","google":"UA-65625003-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
