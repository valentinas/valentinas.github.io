### Fermenting vegetables
Fermenting vegetables is quite easy. Easiest example of that is souerkrout. In order to ferment souerkrout you will need to finely chop the white cabbage and add 2.5% of salt in weight.  You can also add carraway seeds (0.5% by weight), carrots (grated, up to 12% by weight). Keep in mind that salt content has to be 2.5% by weight of the total mixture to prevent spoilage.

After mixing everything thoroughly use your hands to squeze the cabbage to encourage the flow of juice. Then use your fists or some wooden implement to pack the cabbage. By this point there should be a lot of liquid in the fermenting vessel. It should completely cover tha cabbage, with about 1 to 2 cm of liquid on top.

Put a big plate on top of the cabbage and use something heavy to weigh it down to prevent cabbage from rising above the liquid level.

Ferment for 2-3 weeks in the temperature of 10-20C. This fermentation process is done by lactobacillus bacteria. Ideal temperature for this bacteria to grow is 30-40C, however at temperatures that high, the enzimes in the cabbage will start doing their work and it will rot the cabbage (or something to that extent, I have't tried it). That's why the temperature has to be kept low enought so that the enzimes do not spoil the cabbage.

I usually ferment for two weeks at 18-22C. After that I taste it. If it's not sour enough - I let it ferment a little bit longer.

After it's fermented I put it in the jars and keep it in the fridge. If you have a deep cold basement, you can keep it in the basement too.

It is very important to make sure that you clean and sanitise all your equipment. This will ensure that no mould or unwanted yest/bacteria will start growing.
