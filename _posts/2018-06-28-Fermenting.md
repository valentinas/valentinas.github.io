### Fermenting Sauerkraut
Fermenting vegetables is quite easy. Easiest example of that is sauerkraut. In order to ferment sauerkraut you will need to finely chop the white cabbage (2mm slicing blade on food processor works well if you don't want to do it by hand) and add 2.5% of salt in weight. You can also add caraway seeds (50g for 10kg of cabbage), carrots (grated, up to 1kg for 10kg of cabbage). Keep in mind that salt content has to be 2.5% by weight of the total mixture to prevent spoilage.

After mixing everything thoroughly use your hands to squeeze the cabbage to encourage the flow of juice. Then use your fists or some wooden implement to pack the cabbage. By this point there should be a lot of liquid in the fermenting vessel. It should completely cover the cabbage, with about 1 to 2 cm of liquid on top.

Put a big plate, round cutting board or something else on top of the cabbage and use something heavy (e.g. bottle or jar filled with water) to weigh it down and prevent cabbage from rising above the liquid level.

Ferment for 1-3 weeks in the temperature of 15-20C.
 
The fermenting time will vary (depending on things like fermenting temperature, thickness in which cabbage is sliced, etc). Start tasting the sauerkraut after one week. Once it tastes good - you are done. 

I try to keep the temperature just below 20C. That way fermentation is done quickly (usually 1 week is enough), and the sauerkraut remains crunchy. I tried to ferment at 22C but the sauerkraut lost a lot of its crunchiness and the taste was not as good.

After the sauerkraut is fermented I put it in the jars and keep it in the fridge. If you have a deep cold basement, you can keep it in the basement too. It can be kept refrigerated for over 6 months. 

I use a fermenting bucket from brewing supply store. It has an added benefit of having an airlock. It allows you to see how much gas is being produced by the fermentation process. At the start (a day or two days in) it becomes quite vigorous and at the end it dies down and almost ceases completely (as all the sugar has been converted to lactic acid).

It is very important to make sure that you clean and sanitise all your equipment. This will ensure that no mould or unwanted yest/bacteria will start growing.

The rule of thumb with any fermenting is - if it looks fine, smells fine, and tastes fine - it is fine. Meaning that if something will go wrong - it's not going to be subtle. The only bad thing that i have seen happen to sauerkraut is yeast (or mould?) contamination, where the liquid becomes all slimy. Needless to say in that case the batch will have to be discarded.

Interesting note: sauerkraut fermentation process is done by Lactobacillus bacteria. Ideal temperature for this bacteria to grow is 30-40C, however at temperatures that high, the enzymes in the cabbage will start doing their work and it will rot the cabbage (or something to that extent, I haven't tried it). That's why the temperature has to be kept low enough so that the enzymes do not spoil the cabbage.
