### Fermenting vegetables
Fermenting vegetables is quite easy. Easiest example of that is sauerkraut. In order to ferment sauerkraut you will need to finely chop the white cabbage and add 2.5% of salt in weight.  You can also add caraway seeds (50g for 10kg of cabbage), carrots (grated, up to 1kg for 10kg of cabbage). Keep in mind that salt content has to be 2.5% by weight of the total mixture to prevent spoilage.

After mixing everything thoroughly use your hands to squeeze the cabbage to encourage the flow of juice. Then use your fists or some wooden implement to pack the cabbage. By this point there should be a lot of liquid in the fermenting vessel. It should completely cover the cabbage, with about 1 to 2 cm of liquid on top.

Put a big plate on top of the cabbage and use something heavy to weigh it down to prevent cabbage from rising above the liquid level.

Ferment for 2-3 weeks in the temperature of 10-20C. This fermentation process is done by lactobacillus bacteria. Ideal temperature for this bacteria to grow is 30-40C, however at temperatures that high, the enzymes in the cabbage will start doing their work and it will rot the cabbage (or something to that extent, I haven't tried it). That's why the temperature has to be kept low enough so that the enzymes do not spoil the cabbage.

The fermenting time will vary. It will usually be between 1 and 3 weeks. Start tasting the sauerkraut after one week. Once it tastes good - you are done. 

Fermenting in warmer environment will result in shorter fermenting time, but the sauerkraut might lose it's crunchiness as a result of enzymes doing their job. If you want to make sure that your sauerkraut is crunchy - ferment it in lower temperature. It's worth starting the fermentation in higher temperature (~20C) for a day or two, but after it starts going you can do the rest of the fermentation at around 10C.

After the sauerkraut is fermented I put it in the jars and keep it in the fridge. If you have a deep cold basement, you can keep it in the basement too.

It is very important to make sure that you clean and sanitise all your equipment. This will ensure that no mould or unwanted yest/bacteria will start growing.
